Create a console application written in C# that implements a following method:

public static int Evaluate(string expression);

The "Evaluate"	method accepts a math expression with Roman digits, evaluates it and returns a result in decimal format. For example: "I+II-I" = 2 or "X-V"=5. Allowed operators: "+", "-", "*". The method should also validate an input argument by following rules:
	- "expression" argument shouldn't be null or empty
	- "expression" should contain only whitespaces, allowed operators: "+", "-", "*" and letters: M = 1000, D = 500, C = 100, L = 50, X = 10, V = 5, I = 1
	- No parentheses, punctuation mark or decimal digits 
	- It should be a valid math expression

Evaluation criteria:
1. Correctness and business requirements fulfillment
2. Code readability
3. Lines of code
4. Usage of existing .net tools, lack of low-level data manipulations
5. C# version 5.0 or higher
6. .net framework 4.5 or .net core 2.0 or greater

Nice to have:
7. Unit tests
